    <p> As you can probably tell by the way I'm delivering this "letter" I'm a computer science student here at ewu. Our eyes have met a couple of times and I hope you'll recall that once I tell you who I am.
    I've noticed your beauty straight away but I honestly just couldn't bring myself to talk to you, so I figured out this would be the perfect time to reach out. After some digging I found out that you're an international athlete, which only made you more interesting.
